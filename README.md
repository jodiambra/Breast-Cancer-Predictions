## Dataset

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image in 3-dimensional space. This web application lets you alter the various characteristics and makes a prediction on the type of cancer: benign or malignant.
